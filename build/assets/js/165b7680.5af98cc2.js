However, the encryption process can be resource-intensive at multiple levels. Firstly, the amount of CPU required for encryption varies depending on the chosen algorithm, and more complex algorithms tend to demand higher computational power. Additionally, encryption can lead to increased storage requirements as it inflates the size of the data being stored because it typically contains additional metadata and padding, which is especially noticeable for smaller files. Furthermore, encryption is a repetitive task that needs to be performed each time data is fetched or updated. This repetitive nature can contribute to increased energy consumption, especially in high-throughput systems.","permalink":"/catalog/requirements/encrypt-what-is-necessary"},{"id":"catalog/cloud/scan-for-vulnerabilities","title":"Scan for vulnerabilities","description":"Many attacks on cloud infrastructure seek to misuse deployed resources, which leads to an unnecessary spike in usage and cost.","permalink":"/catalog/cloud/scan-for-vulnerabilities"},{"id":"catalog/cloud/evaluate-whether-to-use-TLS-termination","title":"Terminate TLS at border gateway","description":"Transport Layer Security (TLS) ensures that all data passed between the web server and web browsers remain private and encrypted.
